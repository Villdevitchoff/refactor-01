# refactor-01
This is a mockup website provided to me by my lovely instructors as a challenge to be graded by their gloriuous spider colleagues. I will demonstrate my hand at cleaning up jenky and/or smelly smells. These technical terms imply numerous ways of "refactoring code" into clean , well commented, and easy to read code that is in a ready form so to allow features to be added cohesively by future developement.
Some key points of this refactoring is to ensure accessability of the site for persons with dissabilities, ensure all links work, and images etc.
The general purpose of refactoring is not to change the user interface experierence (although improvements may be noticed), rather to enable the developement of code to be refactered wonderful and excellent according to the world wide web developement comunity.
The initial commit will demonstrate timeliness upon a deadline.
Moreover , the task is at hand at pace with gainful practice and understanding unfinished yet.
